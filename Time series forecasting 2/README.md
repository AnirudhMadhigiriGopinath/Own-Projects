Tasks
Imagine you are advisors of the German government. Today, your help is needed to analyse the threats of new Covid-19 variants like delta. Specifically, you are supposed to find out:

Use case 1) How did the delta variant change the Covid-19 situation in countries like United Kingdom, India and Russia?

Use case 2) Can you explain why these countries were initially more affected by the delta variant than other countries like Germany? What can be the reason for this? What helped delta spread? For example, think about the weather conditions, holidays, etc. Hint: Here you can consider other factors.

Use case 3) How will the delta variant affect the number of cases and deaths in Germany until the end of September?

Use case 4) Building on your previous analyses: How should the German government handle variants like delta? What is your advice? (This task is about interpreting the results and drawing conclusions from it)

Please run the code to see the reults or download the html files to know the approach and results.

To solve the Use case 3 I have used SARIMAX model to forecast.

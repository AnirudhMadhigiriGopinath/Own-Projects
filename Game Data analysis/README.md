# Flash Sale Effect

A Flash sale is a limited period where players receive more Diamonds (the premium currency of this game) than normal for the same amount of money.

2 Flash sales took place:

• First Flash sale: from December 21st 2019, to December 24th 2019. 35% Diamonds bonus for the same price.

• Second Flash sale: from January 28th 2020, to January 30th 2020. 50% Diamonds bonus for the same price.

## Task is to answer two questions:

• What is the effect of the Flash sale on the revenue? How much more (or less) revenue we could achieve with each Flash sale?

• Based on the result of the first question, which one was the most successful Flash sale?

## Approaches and Results

To solve the above tasks,
Firstly, I have used the data provided and used Python programming lamguage to do the data analysis. I have used bar charts and line graphs to visualize the solution. The results are in the folder Visualizations and Conclusion.
